# TIPOFF
Laravel Muli-Site Code for TIPOFF.com, DrewRoberts.com, and affiliated properties owned by Drew Roberts Digital LLC and TIPOFF LLC.

TIPOFF League is an Agency & a Metaverse/IRL Gaming League of 10 teams.

## Installation
After setting up local dev environment with PHP 7.4, you will launch this Laravel 8 app by copying the ``.env.example`` file to ``.env``

From there, create the ``tipoff`` database in MySQL and from the command line run the following commands:

```bash
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan key:generate
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can then view the homepage if you're using Laravel Homestead at https://tipoff.test and can access Laravel Nova at http://tipoff.test/admin
